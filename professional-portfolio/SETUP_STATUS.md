# 🚨 Supabase Setup Required

Your portfolio is running in **development mode** without Supabase configuration.

## Current Status
- ✅ Portfolio website is working
- ✅ Static project display is functional
- ❌ Authentication system needs Supabase setup
- ❌ Dynamic project management needs Supabase setup

## Quick Setup

1. **Visit the setup guide**: Go to `/setup` in your browser for detailed instructions
2. **Or follow these steps**:
   - Create a Supabase project at [supabase.com](https://supabase.com)
   - Update `.env.local` with your Supabase credentials
   - Run the database schema from `supabase/schema.sql`
   - Restart the development server

## What Works Now
- Portfolio homepage with static content

## What Needs Supabase
- User authentication (`/auth/login`, `/auth/signup`)
- Admin dashboard (`/admin`)
- Dynamic project management

2. Test authentication by creating an account
3. Add your real projects via the admin dashboard
4. Deploy to production
